# Space Invaders ðŸ‘½
(this is a toy project - just for fun)

After watching many implementations of this wonderful and iconic game, I decided to spend some free time trying to implement my own version of it using Python and the [Pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/) library.
The code is written by me and will be updated from time to time when I'll pick it up again to add something else.

## Multimedia content

- **Graphics**: every sprite (everything exept for the background image) has been created by me using [pixilart](https://www.pixilart.com/);
- **Sound**: each audio file has been downloaded from [Bensound.com](https://www.bensound.com/);

## Download and play 

In order to play the game you need to have Python3.* installed on your machine and the Pygame library. In order to install it:
```
python3 -m pip install pygame
```

Once it's installed, you need to just:
```
cd code # change directory to the "code" directory which contains the python files
python3 main.py # execute the "main.py" file
```

Congratulations! You've just been enlisted for the defense of our beloved planet from the evil green-faced aliens that are approaching it. They are planning to build a base on the moon in order to transfer the rest of the fleet and get ready for the invasion. Good luck space man! ðŸš€ (or woman, or whatever you want to put after the word "space"... "space kitten" maybe?)
