# Space Invaders ðŸ‘½

![SI_screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82440452/158659398-76a0948b-c186-438a-a60e-b7b6ddd2795d.JPG)

After watching many implementations of this wonderful and iconic game, I decided to spend some free time trying to implement my own version of it using Python and the [Pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/) library.
The code is written by me and will be updated from time to time when I'll pick it up again to add something else.

## Multimedia content

- **Graphics**: every sprite (everything exept for the background image) has been created by me using [pixilart](https://www.pixilart.com/);
- **Sound**: each audio file has been downloaded from [Bensound.com](https://www.bensound.com/);

## Download and play 

In order to play the game you need to have Python3.* installed on your machine and the Pygame library. In order to install it:
```
python3 -m pip install pygame
```

Once it's installed, you need to just:
```
cd code # change directory to the "code" directory which contains the python files
main.py # execute the "main.py" file
```

Congratulations! You've just been enlisted for the defense of our beloved planet from the evil green-faced aliens that are approaching it. They are planning to build a base on the moon in order to transfer the rest of the fleet and get ready for the invasion. Good luck space man! (or woman, or whatever you want to put after the word "space"... "space kitten" maybe? ðŸ˜¸ðŸ‘¾)

## License

There is no license attached to this repository, so feel free to download it, change it, use parts of this code in your project, use my sprites, or do anything you want with it ðŸŽˆ (but if you do, just for my personal curiosity please contact me to tell me that you did, and maybe even what you are doing/planning to do with it, I'd be glad to know! ðŸ˜ƒ)
